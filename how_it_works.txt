CODE STRUCTURE:

app -> 
src -> components -> Playground
                  -> Sidebar
    -> reusables  -> Element
                  -> Input
                  -> Modal
    -> utils      -> Constants

STEPS TO RUN:

1.git clone https://github.com/SujaiKrishnaK/drag-and-drop.git
2.cd drag-and-drop
3.npm install
4.npm start

CODE FLOW:

1. Element's Drag Icon on mousedown will make the 
   parent div draggable(mouse up -> draggable = false)
2. On Drag event will trigger drag handler in App.js
3. In drag handler we will set the dragged element and set current element to be configured
4. On Drop event will be triggered in playground, here we get x and y position of mouse
    and call the open modal function passing x and y.
5. open modal will trigger the modal, where we configure x y font height font weight text (defined in utils/constants)
6. on clicking save changes configuration will be pushed into elements
7. elements will be mapped inside playground and rendered in UI based on configs

    A.Edit
1. on key down event on any element we open modal.
2. edit any input elements
3. on save changes we find the object of the element and save it to elements 
to re render

    B. Delete
1. detect key down delete event
2. filter elements and save

    C. for mobile
1. onTouchEndCapture, onTouchStart, onTouchEnd
    we use these to drag and drop on touch devices

    D. Persist
1. on every change of elements state - we save it local storage
2. retrieved when refreshed

    E. JSON Export
1. Added a link to download JSON file of elements dropped
